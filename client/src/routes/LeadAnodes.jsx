            <h3>We offer a variety of cast or extruded anodes in a wide range of configurations, such as Grids and Baskets. Each of our anodes go through the same process to produce a fine grain structure essential to even plate-out and maximum throwing power of the plating solution.
                We stock the following metals to produce any alloy you require:
