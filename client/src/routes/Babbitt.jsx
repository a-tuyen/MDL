            <h2>OFTEN USED AS BEARING METAL FOR AXLES AND CRANKSHAFTS TO REDUCE FRICTION BETWEEN THE METALS</h2>
            <h3>We offer a variety of tin and lead based alloys that will suit a variety of applications. When selecting Babbitt type, important factors to consider are bearing use, shaft surface speed and load factor. If a bearing is highly loaded in relation to its size, a high tin alloy is desirable; whereas lead-based alloys are suited for much slower speed work and less heavily loaded bearings.
                Below are the common Babbitts that we produce:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MD-4X (also called Nickel Genuine)</li>
                <li>Heavy Pressure (also called Harris Heavy Pressure)</li>
                <li>Saw Guide Babbitt</li>
                <li>#4 Babbitt</li>
                <li>Mill Anchor</li>
                <li>Soft Choker</li>
                <li>Choker Zinc</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>We are also able to produce custom Babbitt that meets your composition requirements</h3>
