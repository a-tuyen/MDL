            <h3>OFTEN USED AS BEARING METAL FOR AXLES AND CRANKSHAFTS TO REDUCE FRICTION BETWEEN THE METALS</h3>
            <p>We offer a variety of tin and lead based alloys that will suit a variety of applications. When selecting Babbitt type, important factors to consider are bearing use, shaft surface speed and load factor. If a bearing is highly loaded in relation to its size, a high tin alloy is desirable; whereas lead-based alloys are suited for much slower speed work and less heavily loaded bearings.
            </p>
